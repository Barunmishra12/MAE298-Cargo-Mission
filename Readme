Readme


Baseline Mission Run:
To run the baseline mission using the advanced single aisle aircraft, download advanced_single_aisle_baseline_FLOPS.csv file and add it to the folder within Aviary where advanced_single_aisle_FLOPS.csv file is located.
This should be located with the following extension: aviary\models\aircraft\advanced_single_aisle. This model has been updated to include 52,000 lbm of cargo and has all of the internal passenger features removed.
Then download baseline_updated.py file and emissions.py. Then run with either the SLSQP or IPOPT solvers for fuel burn and emissions.


Geometry Subsystem Optimization:
To run the geometry subsystem optimization, follow the same steps as in the baseline mission run to download advanced_single_aisle_baseline_FLOPS.csv. Then download geometry_updated.py and emissions.py, then run with either SLSQP or IPOPT solvers. This will optimize the aircraft's geometry for the base line mission. 
Design variables include:
- Wing aspect ratio, area, sweep, taper, and dihedral
- Fuselage length, max width, and max height
- Horizontal tail area, aspect ratio, and taper ratio

Tech setup for this version: Please follow the steps in the order listed.

Install the OpenVSO API. This will create a environment (default env name: vsppytools), and you need a version with a Python version higher than 3.9.
Active env vsppytools, then install pyFlightscript, make sure you have FlighStream GUI installed and working.
Colone env vsppytools with a new name (you can pick one you want, for example: py_OFA) in case of package conflicts.
Active emv py_OFA, install Aviary, pyoptsparse, cyipopt. (There may be some problems due to package conflicts; Mamba installation is recommended.) Command listed below: conda install -c conda-forge mamba mamba install -c conda-forge pyoptsparse mamba install -c conda-forge cyipopt
Check all the packages by typing the following command one by one: pip show openvsp, pip show pyFlightscript, pip show aviary, pip show openMADAO, pip show pyoptsparse, pip show cyipopt.
Workflow one: Use FlightStream to generate aero_polar and load back. See Polar_FS_Comp folder.

Save these files to your Aviray file in a suitable place. (Eg: C/User/Aviary/Subsystem/Aerodynamics/FlightStream_based)
Update several file paths in GeometryCreator.py, FSpolarAeroComp.py, geo_oas_opt_FSpolar.py
Run GeometryCreator.py first to generate a CAD model for FLightStream.
Run FSpolarAeroComp.py to generate a high-fidelity aerodynamics polar.
Run geo_oas_opt_FSpolar.py to get optimization results.


Integrated Subsystem Optmization:
To run the integrated subsystem optimization, download all of the files listed above and follow the aerodynamics subsystem guide.
