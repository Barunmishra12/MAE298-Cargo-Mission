Aerodynamic subsystem:

This code is for the Aerodynamic subsystem optimization Main code: Aviary, OpenMDAO Extra CFD solver: FlightStream 2025.1 AI statement: These codes are generated with the assistance of ChatGPT 5.1

Tech setup for this version: Please follow the steps in the order listed.

Install the OpenVSO API. This will create a environment (default env name: vsppytools), and you need a version with a Python version higher than 3.9.
Active env vsppytools, then install pyFlightscript, make sure you have FlighStream GUI installed and working.
Colone env vsppytools with a new name (you can pick one you want, for example: py_OFA) in case of package conflicts.
Active emv py_OFA, install Aviary, pyoptsparse, cyipopt. (There may be some problems due to package conflicts; Mamba installation is recommended.) Command listed below: conda install -c conda-forge mamba mamba install -c conda-forge pyoptsparse mamba install -c conda-forge cyipopt
Check all the packages by typing the following command one by one: pip show openvsp, pip show pyFlightscript, pip show aviary, pip show openMADAO, pip show pyoptsparse, pip show cyipopt.
Workflow one: Use FlightStream to generate aero_polar and load back. See Polar_FS_Comp folder.

Save these files to your Aviray file in a suitable place. (Eg: C/User/Aviary/Subsystem/Aerodynamics/FlightStream_based)
Update several file paths in GeometryCreator.py, FSpolarAeroComp.py, geo_oas_opt_FSpolar.py
Run GeometryCreator.py first to generate a CAD model for FLightStream.
Run FSpolarAeroComp.py to generate a high-fidelity aerodynamics polar.
Run geo_oas_opt_FSpolar.py, which is already combined with Geometry Optimization.
